r2d2b2g is an experimental prototype test environment for Firefox OS
in the form of a Firefox Desktop addon for
[Linux](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-linux.xpi),
[Mac](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-mac.xpi), and
[Windows (crashy)](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/r2d2b2g/r2d2b2g-windows.xpi).

To hack on it, clone this repository, then:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    make build
    make run

Caution! You need plentiful disk and patience, as the submodules and build process require copious space and time.
