/** Class AdbApiInstance is the main API interbal object representing a device
  interface that is in the interest of the API client. All device (interface)
  related operations go through this class first. So, before doing anything
  meaningfull with the API a client must first create instance of the API
  via CreateAdbApiInstance, select a device interface for that instance and
  then do everything else.
  Objects of this class are globally stored in the map that matches
  ADBAPIINSTANCEHANDLE to the corresponded object.
  This class is self-referenced with the following reference model:
  1. When object of this class is created and added to the map, its recount
     is set to 1.
  2. Every time the client makes an API call that uses ADBAPIINSTANCEHANDLE
     a corresponded AdbApiInstance object is looked up in the table and its
     refcount is incremented. Upon return from the API call that incremented
     the refcount refcount gets decremented.
  3. When the client closes ADBAPIINSTANCEHANDLE via DeleteAdbApiInstance call
     corresponded object gets deleted from the map and its refcount is
     decremented.
  So, at the end, this object destroys itself when refcount drops to zero.
