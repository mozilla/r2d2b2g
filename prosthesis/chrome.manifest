# B2G's "content" stylesheet removes styles from a variety of XUL widgets we use
# in parts of the Simulator interface, making them hard to recognize, so we
# remove that stylesheet by overriding it with our own.  Note that our
# stylesheet doesn't actually exist, nor does it have to: merely specifying it
# prevents the B2G one from loading. But we can create it at some point to apply
# our own style (including style from the B2G sheet that we end up wanting).
